## Variables in Ansible


## What I Achieved
Automated server configurations using variables to:
âœ” Eliminate hardcoded values in playbooks
âœ” Reuse the same playbook across different environments (dev/stage/prod)
âœ” Separate sensitive data from code (prep for Ansible Vault)

## Challenges I Solved

  ## Problem	                                              ## Solution
 
1. Playbook failed when variables were missing	  -   I Added validation: when: db_host is defined 

2. Mixed up variable precedence	                  -   Learned order: cli > playbook vars > inventory vars

3. Needed environment-specific configs	          -   Created separate prod_vars.yml, dev_vars.yml


## This lab taught me:

ğŸ”¹ Maintainability: Change values in one place (vars file) vs. digging through playbooks

ğŸ”¹ Security: Prepared me for Ansible Vault (next step for secrets)

ğŸ”¹ Teamwork: Others can reuse my playbooks with their own variables
